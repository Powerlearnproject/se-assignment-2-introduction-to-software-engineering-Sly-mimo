# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
```
Software engineering is the process of designing, development, testing, and maintenance of software applications. Traditional programming on the other hand includes just to code development to solve a specific proplem without using a specific software development
lifecycle model.
```

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

```
The phases are
- Phase 1: Planning.
    Involves high level defininition of the software’s purpose and scope as well as milestones and timeframes
- Phase 2: Requirements Analysis.
    Gathering concise requirements from the users on what the apllications is suppossed to do as well as information on the infrastracture required to run the application
- Phase 3: Design.
    Generating design diagrams usin UMLs to guid in the coding phase
- Phase 4: Coding.
    Actual code writing of the application
- Phase 5: Testing.
    Ensuring the developed application meets the requirements specified in phase 2
- Phase 6: Deployment.
    Providing users access to the application for use in their day to day activties
-Phase 7: Maintenance.
    Fixing bugs that may arise after deployments as well as adding new features
```
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
| Agile              | Waterfall |
| --------           | -------   |
| Flexible timelines | Fixed well defined timelines |
| Iterative developments where previous phases can be revisited | Fixed phases where on has to complete before starting the next |
| Client is involved during the whole process    | Clients is mostly involved during requirement gathering stage |

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
```
The process of defining, documenting, and maintaining requirements. It involves activities like elicitation, analysis, specification, and verification to ensure software meets stakeholders’ needs. Proper management improves project clarity, reduces errors, and aligns expectations.
```
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
```
 is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.
```
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
```
Testing is crucial as it ensures that no new bugs are introduced to the system or existing features are not broken by new changes
- unit testing - verifies the accuracy of a smaller, isolated block of application code, typically a function or method
- integration testing - components of the software are gradually integrated and then tested as a unified group
- system testing - testing the complete system to ensure that it meets the specified requirements
- acceptance testing - software testing that evaluates whether a system meets its business and user requirements

```
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
```
VCS keeps track of every modification allowing versioning and history of the changes done to the code files. It is important as it shows the history of how th e code eveolved to the current version.
Examples
- git
- subversion
- mercurial
```
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
```
He is involved in the project planning, monitoring and control.
- project estimation
- project scheduling
- Project staffing
```
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
```
Software maintenance refers to the activities performed to keep software systems operational, reliable, and efficient after coding and testing and released to end users.

- Corrective Maintenance: fix defects and bugs in the software to restore functionality.
- Adaptive Maintenance: Modifies the software to adapt to changes in the operating environment, such as hardware upgrades, new operating systems, or changes in business requirements.
- Perfective Maintenance: Enhances the software's functionality, performance, or usability by adding new features or improving existing ones.
```
Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
```
Ethical issues
- Unethiacl data collection
- Software Piracy
```
